README
======

This repository contains the implementation of algorithms PP, RPP, SDPP, SDRPP, ADPP, and ADRPP described in the article 

M. Čáp, P. Novák, A. Kleiner, and M. Selecký, “Prioritized planning algorithms for trajectory coordination of multiple mobile robots,” IEEE transactions on automation science and engineering, 2015.

Further, it contains the dataset and script neccessary to reproduce the experimental results reported in the article.

Running the experiments
----------------------
The entire experiment can be recomputed by executing run-experiment.sh script.

The script requires that the following software is installed on the machine where it is executed: 
 * jdk8
 * gnu parallel
 * R programming language.


Inspect the source code
-----------------------
The source code of all solvers used in the experiment is in admap-solver folder. Consult admap-solver/README for details.
